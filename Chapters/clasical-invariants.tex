\begin{defn}
Let $\gamma: [0,1] \to \R^2$ be a smooth curve. The \wddef{gausian map of
$\gamma$} $g: [0,1] \to S^1 \subset \R^2$ is given by
\[ g(t) = \frac{\gamma'(t)}{\|\gamma'(t)\|}. \] 
Where $S^1 \subset \R^2$ is thought of as the unit circle.

Consider the quationt map $q: \R \to \R/\Z = S^1$. There is a unique
(up to translation by $\Z$) lift (by $q$) of $g$, $\tilde{g}$, ie. a map
$\tilde{g}:[0,1]\to \R$ such that $g = q \circ \tilde{g}$. 

rotation number of $r(\gamma) = g(1) - g(0) \in \R$.

Then the \wddef{rotation number of $\gamma$} is $r(\gamma) =
\tilde{g}(1) - \tilde{g}(0)$.
\end{defn}

Note that, if the path is closed, $r(\gamma) \in \Z$. Also the rotation number
invariant under reparameterization, so we may write $r(\im(\gamma))$.
(In particualt we will write $r(L) \in \Z$, for the rotation number of $L$ )
