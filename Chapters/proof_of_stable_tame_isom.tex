In this section we will prove Theorem \ref{prop:stable_tame_inv}, claming that the stable
type of the assosiaded \Ainf-algebra is invarient under legendrian isotopy.

\subsection{Legendrian Reidemeister Moves}
Consider a generic Legendrien isotopy $\{L_t\}$ connecting $L_0$ and $L_1$, and
let $Y_t = \pi(L_t)$ denote the Lagrangian projection. Throughout the
deformation a finite number of bifurcations or Reidemeister moves (see Figure
\ref{fig:reid_moves} ) may occur. 
If no bifurcations occurs for $t\in[x,y]$, it is clear by the definition of the
associated \Ainf-algebra that $(A_{L_x},m_{L_x})$ and $(A_{L_y}, m_{L_y})$ are
naturally isomorphic. So In order to prove that the stable type of the
associated \Ainf-algebra is preserved throughout the isotopy, it suffices to
prove that it is preserved by the bifurcations.

Note that the third Reidemeister move has two version, both preserving the number
of crossings, whereas the second does not. 
\comment{( The first Reidemeier move can not be realized as a Legendrian
isotopy, because it does not preserve the rotation number. )} 
We will see that for in either of the two versions of the third move the \Ainf-algebra changes by a tame isomorphism. 
In the case of the second move we will also need to stabilize, since
the number of crossings has changed.

Suppose a bifurcation occurs at $t = t'$. Consider a small $\epsilon > 0$ and let
$(A^\pm, m^\pm) = (A_{L_{t\pm\epsilon}}, m_{L_{t\pm\epsilon}})$. 
Without loss of generality, we will assume that for $t\in[t'-\epsilon, t'+\epsilon]$ the projection of the knot is unchanged
outside a small neighbourhood of where the bifurcation occurs.
