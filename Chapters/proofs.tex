In this chapter we will takel the proof of the two most centereal theorems in
this paper. Theorem \pref{prop:a_inf_rels} and \pref{prop:stable_tame_inv}. 
Since we are spesificly working with the standard contactstructure on $\R^3$ and
more spesificly the lagrandian projection,Â the proofs will nauturaly reduce to a
combinatorial agrument.

Throught this chapter we will consider a fixed but arbitrary Legendrian knot
$L$ and it's Lagrangian projection $Y = \pi(L)$.

Both of the proofs, including the lemmas presente in the first section is an
adoptation of the the proofs given in \cite{chekanov02}. (Addapted to the
language of \Ainf-algebras.)
